    - #### Windows:
        - Creating virtual environment
        ```bash
        python -m venv toto_number_analysis_venv
        ```

        - Activating virtual environment
        ```
        toto_number_analysis\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - #### Mac:
        - Creating virtual environment
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv toto_number_analysis
        ```

        - Activating virtual environment
        ```
        source toto_number_analysis/bin/activate
        ```

    - #### Deactivating virtual environment (Windows/Mac)
        - Same for Windows / Mac
        ```bash
        deactivate
        ```

4. **Install necessary libraries from requirements.txt file into virtual environment**:
    ```bash
